Math309 Continous Optimization Machine Learning Model (SGD implementations)

In machine learning, optimal model parameters are a fundamental requirement for achieving predictive
accuracy and efficiency. As datasets expand in size and complexity, there is a greater need for utilizing more
efficient optimization methods. While traditional approaches, such as the steepest descent (SD) method,
prove effective on smaller scales, they often struggle to scale seamlessly to the dimensions demanded by
large datasets. This project investigates the application of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and
SD methods, focusing on predicting housing prices through multiple linear regression on a reasonably sized
dataset.
